# Microcontroller in a Guitar Pedal

This is a device that takes in an analog guitar signal, modulates the signal (probably adding a slight delay and detune), then mixes the affected signal back with the original source and outputs the result.  The system will have four buttons to select presets, knobs to create your own sounds, and indicators to tell the user which preset is currently active.
