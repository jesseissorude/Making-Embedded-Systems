# Making-Embedded-Systems
Files, homework, final project, etc for the MES class

I erased everything because I have no idea how git works (-_-;)

This repository is currently being cleaned up and reorganized as I restore what I can find of the documents I had stored locally.  Check the "Final Project" folder for the most recent exercises and code.
